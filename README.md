## Transcripts
Meeting transcripts should be placed in the `meeting-transcripts` directory, using the following naming convention: YY-MM-DD-transcript.md.

These transcripts are AI generated from meeting recordings, so may contain interpretation errors. 

Please reach out to carla@chaincode.com or clara@chaincode.com for clarification if sections of the transcript are unclear, or you're willing to volunteer your time to "human review" the transcriptions!
